# aws secure introduce dynamic length security
This is works as the part of the high level security as the strategy to escape ease brute force attack.
- How does the logic behind that. in that as the point the user can keep tying a password, can correct it by placing del button while authentication goes This is the main strategy
  - The algorthim behind this 
      Lets say i typing 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9 , when i have a sing password character means as i type the string goes
          for length <= number of input boxes:
              password = chr1 || chr1 + char2 || char1 + char2 + char3 || char1 + char2 + char3 + char4

      `What happens when the number of digits is longer than the boxes`
        algorthim
          ``` last-four-password-before-clear + append by char1 || ....```
       The maximum number of password character alllowed is about 10 charcter that means the program only check for 10 queue size to matching password of the user start from the last digit all
        the way to the back of the string until the 10 digits is reached so all combination will be checked out  
- The new security tips
   - The camera will be used to record a configured number of seconds to be record in front camera and save it in secure folder, as showing the foot prints to one tried to bypass security
